          <h1>Hi!</h1>
          <h2>I'm Manasvini.</h2>

          <h4>I started studying and practicing law.</h4>
          <p>I studied law in the University of Oxford, and National Law Institute University.</p>
          <p>After graduating from Oxford, I worked for a few years in a corporate law firm, dealing mostly with transactional law, contracts, and private equity.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="one-section">
          <h4>Then I learned to code.</h4>
          <p>I started to learn Python, and then Django. My learning really accelerated when I started a challenge to make <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160406235455/http://manasvinik.me/25-day-challenge/">one project a day</a>, for a month. One month challenges are my favourite way to learn.</p>
          <p>This also started my journey as a maker, and since, I've created several products, reaching thousands of people.</p>

        <div class="one-section">
          <h4>I created Lawbot, an automated legal contract reviewing engine.</h4>
          <p>Lawbot identifies problematic issues in contractual language, and suggests ways to fix them.</p>          
        </div>

        <div class="one-section">
          <h4>Then I made Serendipity. It introduced you to one (random) awesome person every month.</h4>
          <p>This was such a fun project to work on, and it became hugely popular. The day I <a href="http://producthunt.com/posts/serendipity">launched on Product Hunt</a>, it was voted to be the #1 project for the day.</p>
          <p>It also got nominated for Product Hunt's Tech Product of the Year.</p>
          <p>Over 6000 people used Serendipity, and we made hundreds of wonderful, weird, serendipitous connections.</p>

        <div class="one-section">
          <h4>In 2018, I launched Boss as a Service.</h4>
          <p><a href="https://bossasaservice.life/">Boss as a Service</a> is a productivity service / tool, which gives you a "Boss" -- a real human being who chases you up to make sure you're on track to achieving your goals. If you've ever made a New Year's Resolution and promptly forgotten about it, you know what I mean.</p>
          <p>Boss as a Service went to #1 on Hacker News, and was <a href="https://producthunt.com/posts/boss-as-a-service/">featured on Product Hunt</a>, and I participated in an <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/the-spark-guide-to-life-episode-two-work-productivity-1.5189193/boss-as-a-service-aims-to-help-people-avoid-procrastination-1.4927738">interview on CBC.CA's podcast</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="one-section">
          <h4>I also made Why Do I Procrastinate, the Web MD for Procrastination.</h4>
          <p><a href="https://whydoiprocrastinate.com">Why Do I Procrastinate</a> started as a side project for Boss as a Service. It diagnoses the reason why you're not doing whatever it is you're supposed to be doing. It also got to #1 on Hacker News!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="one-section">
          <h4>Features</h4>
          <p>I was one of the <a href="https://makermag.com/2018/12/21/top-women-makers-2018/" class="link">Top 10 Female Indie Makers of 2018</a>.</p>
          <p>I've been featured on Product Hunt, Hacker News, The Next Web, CBC, Venture Beat, Tech in Asia, The Economic Times, and others.</p>
